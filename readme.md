## Features ✨

- **6 Regression Models** compared using MSE metrics
- **k-fold Cross-Validation** (k=5) for robust evaluation
- Automated dataset loading and preprocessing
- Clear performance reporting with key statistics
- Reproducible results through random state control

## Models Implemented 🤖
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (k=5)
4. Decision Tree (Max Depth=4)
5. Random Forest (50 Estimators)
6. Support Vector Regression (Linear Kernel)

## Installation 🛠️

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/NevilPatel01/regression_analysis_forest_fire.git
```

# Install requirements
```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage 🚀
